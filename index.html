                  Manufacture Period: 1939-1966 Origin: Chicago, USA (Argus
                  Inc.) The Argus C-3, often referred to as "The Brick," is one
                  of the most iconic cameras in photography history. Widely
                  produced during its time, it gained global recognition for its
                  durability and affordability. After World War II, a replica of
                  the Argus C-3 was created and later donated to the Museum of
                  Photography in Kraków by Jan Oberbek. This camera also made an
                  appearance in the 2002 film Harry Potter and the Chamber of
                  Secrets, cementing its legacy in popular culture. In 2010, the
                  Kraków museum officially acquired the Argus C-3, where it
                  remains a part of their collection.

                Manufacture Period: 1914-1927 Origin: Rochester, USA (Eastman
                Kodak) The Kodak Junior A is a folding camera that represents
                Kodak's innovation in early 20th-century photography. Known for
                its elegant design and functionality, it captured moments during
                an era when photography was becoming more accessible. At an
                unspecified time, this camera became part of Ignacy Paderewski’s
                memorabilia collection, adding a touch of historical and
                cultural significance to its story.

                Manufacture Period: Before 1909 Origin: Görlitz, Germany (Ernst
                Herbst & Firl) This classic travel camera is best known for its
                connection to Polish composer Mieczysław Karłowicz, who owned
                and used it extensively in the early 20th century. In 1909,
                Karłowicz tragically perished in an avalanche while skiing in
                Zakopane, Poland. After his death, Stanisław Barabasz developed
                the film left in the camera, capturing a poignant snapshot of
                Karłowicz’s final moments. Today, the camera and the photos it
                took are preserved in the Tatra Museum in Zakopane, embodying
                both artistic and historical significance.

                Manufacture Period: 1966 Origin: Warsaw, Poland (WZFO – Warsaw
                Photo-Optical Works) The Zefir camera is a fascinating example of
                photographic innovation that was never fully realized. Only two
                prototypes were created, each featuring distinct lenses: the Emitar
                and the Domiplan. However, due to fierce competition from
                manufacturers in the USSR and GDR, mass production was never
                achieved. In 1995, the two prototypes were gifted to the Museum of
                Photography in Kraków by Stefan Surde, preserving their legacy as a
                rare piece of photographic history.
